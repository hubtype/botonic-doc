# **Human Handoff**

[View on Github](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic/tree/master/templates/handoff)

This template shows a very simple case of use where a user is transferred to a human agent through the chatbot. This conversation will appear as a new case on a ticketing tool like Zendesk, Hubtype Desk or Front. This integrations are only available from the botonic dashboard, so you must deploy your bot to try this feature.

In this example we've set up a route in `botonic.config.js` that triggers the handoff when a user types "handoff":

```javascript
module.exports = {
    routes: [
        {text: /^handoff$/i, action: "transfer_agent"}
    ]
}
```

Then, in our `pages/actions/transfer_agent.js` file, we need to call the `humanHandoff` method inside `botonicInit({ req })` (which is executed when this action is triggered):

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Botonic } from 'botonic'

export default class extends Botonic.React.Component {

  static async botonicInit({ req }) {

   this.humanHandOff(req)
  
  }

  render() {
    return (
        <message type="text">
            Please, wait a second. You are being transferred to an agent.
        </message>
    )
  }
}

```
