# **Natural Language Understanding**

[View on Github](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic/tree/master/templates/intent)

This template shows a simple case of use where we use an integration, specifically `Dialogflow` integration.

The integration with `dialogflow` is super easy, we have to enter in `botonic.config.js` and add the `dialogflow api token` to enable the integration.

```javascript
integrations: {
    /* Uncomment this to enable NLP with Dialogflow
    dialogflow: {
        token: "YOUR_DIALOGFLOW_API_TOKEN"
    }*/
}

```

Then in `src/routes.js`, we will add the `dialogflow intents` that we want for our chatbot. The `intents` contain a set of words and / or phrases that when written by the user, the chatbot will search the corresponding `intent` and call the corresponding action. Here we have an example of how to call the `intents`:

```javascript
routes: [
    /* Captures different intents (enable the Dialogflow integration,
    see "integrations" section at the top of this file) */
    {intent: "smalltalk.greetings.hello", action: "hi"},
    {intent: "smalltalk.greetings.bye", action: "bye"}
]
```

You can have as many `intents` as you want, and each one will call a component of the chatbot.
