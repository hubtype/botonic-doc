# **Webviews**

Webviews are an essential part of Botonic and chatbots. This allows you to open standard webpages during a chat conversation, offering a rich experience and a set of features that are difficult to create with simple RCML messages.

One simple example could be the posibility of creating a webview for picking different products, selecting a range of dates from a datepicker or even buying some books.

With Botonic, it's easier to create webview than developing by your own a webpage and integrate it with the Facebook app, insert the Facebook SDK, keep the bot conversation flow, etc.

## Structure of webviews directory
All the code related to webviews resides into its respective `src/webviews` directory. These are the essential elements it has to contain:
- **index.html**: index.html permits that Javascript can access and change elements of the HTML DOM. Facebook SDK is needed for opening a webview inside Messenger platform, so we have encapsulated this information inside of it.
- **index.js**: in index.js is where we can define the paths for our components inside the parent class App. Additionaly, it includes in its constructor method, a way of retrieving the context object from the bot.
- **styles.css**: this is where you can define your css (also scss) properties. 
- **components**: here you can include all the React Components you develop.

> #### NOTE:
> The main purpose of this structure is that you don't have to worry about the communication between the bot and the webviews, in order that you can focus just on adding new routes to index.js and developing new components, so if you do any modifications, do it at your own risk!


## **Steps**

Now, let's integrate the bot with the webviews.

## Invoking the webview

You can only open a webview after a `button` or `quickreply`. For this example, create an action to invoke the webviews, as shown in the example. In this case, we named a route which will be resolved by `src/webviews/index.js`.

**src/actions/invoking_webviews.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react'

export default class extends React.Component {

    static async botonicInit({ req }) {
        
        //Here we define the data that will be passed from the bot to the webview.
        //We managed for you how to pass the context object to the webviews.
        req.context.some_data = "some_data"
    }

    render() {
        //Here we render a Facebook Carrousel with its propers assets and url routes for the webview
        return (
            <messages>
                <message type="text">
                    Here I lend you some options of how helpful the use of Facebook webviews could be.
                </message>
                <message type="carrousel">
                    <element>
                        <pic>/assets/interact_with_bot.jpeg</pic>
                        <title>Interacting with the bot</title>
                        <desc>See how the communication bot-webview is done</desc>
                        <button webview_height_ratio="tall" url="/webviews/invoking_webviews">Go</button>
                    </element>
                </message>
            </messages>
        )
    }
}
```

>#### NOTE:
> You can also set the [dimensions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webview/#height) of the webview (available on Messenger phone version).


## Creating a component

First of all, we create a new component inside `src/webviews/components`.

**src/webviews/components/InvokingWebviews.js**

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "reactstrap";
import { BotonicWebview } from "@botonic/react";

class InvokingWebviews extends React.Component {
  //for further information, see: https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    //Here you can define all the state variables you will have to deal with
    this.state = {
    };

  }

  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = "MyBot | InvokingWebviews";
  }

  close() {
    BotonicWebview.close(this.props.context, "DATA_returned_data");
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <div className="invoking-webviews">
          <h4>This is a variable coming from the bot:</h4>
          <p>{this.props.context.some_data}</p>
          <Button onClick={ () => this.close()}>Click me to send data back</Button>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default InvokingWebviews;
```

>#### NOTE:
>The close function allows you to send data back to the bot in order to continue with the conversation flow.
In this example, you can see that we have a button, and when it's triggered we send a postback to the bot with 'DATA_returned_data' as a `payload`.


## Adding components into routes

After having our component created, now we can move to `src/webviews/index.js`. Simply, add a new Route tag with the path described in our action and the component we have just created. This will render the new component passing the context object as a prop.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import InvokingWebviews from "./components/InvokingWebviews.js";
import "./styles.scss";

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    //Below piece of code is used to preserve the bot context.
    var url_string = window.location.href;
    var url = new URL(url_string);
    var context = JSON.parse(url.searchParams.get("context"));
    //Then we can store the bot's context in our state variable
    this.state = {
      context: context
    };
  }

  render() {

    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <Route
          path="/invoking_webviews"
          render={() => <InvokingWebviews context={this.state.context} />}
        />                  
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}

render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```
