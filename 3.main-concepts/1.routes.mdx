# **Routes**

Basically, routes map user inputs to actions (React Components)

## User inputs

The user input is captured as an object that has some fields:

* **Type:** it is the input type, and it can be one of the followings:  
`text`, `postback`, `audio`, `image`,  `video`, `document`, `location`, `referral` 

* **Data:** contains raw text (or attachment URL if it's a media type). 

* **Payload:** field is used when the user has clicked on a button or quick reply. 

* **Intent:** which match Intent ID according to the NLP backend with the integration.

```javascript
{
    type: "text", 
    data: "Hello!"
    payload: "",
    intent: "smalltalk.greeting"
}
```

## Mapping user inputs into actions

Every route, which is an entry in the routes' array can be defined in `src/routes.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    routes: [

    ]
}
```

Conceptually, a route is composed by a matching rule and an action. A matching rule looks like this: `{attribute: test}`,  
which basically means: "take that attribute from the user input and apply the test" if test passes, the action defined in that route will be triggered.

There are 4 different ways of passing these tests:
* **String:** Perfect match
* **Regexp:** Pass the regular expression
* **Function:** Passes if the function returns true
* **Input:** Passes if the condition is met

The rules will be tested in order so if the 1st rule matches, Botonic won't test
other routes and will execute the 1st action.
If there are several matching rules in the same route, all of them have to pass
to consider a match.

In the following example, the first rule matches if and only if we get the text `start` and will execute the
React component defined in `src/actions/start.js`

```javascript
{text: "start", action: "start"}
```
Below, another text rule (perfect match) to trigger the `end` action
```javascript
{text: "end", action: "end"}
```
These rules use a case insensitive regexp to match text messages that contain
a certain text. For the example below, will capture 'BUTTONS', 'Buttons', etc. 

```javascript
{text: /^buttons$/i, action: "buttons"}
```
If you want to use regexp with grouped values, you need to upgrade Node to `v.10`
or ahead. This regular expression match `age-{NUMBER}` where NUMBER can be any digit.
Then, in your component `bye`, you can access to this in `req.params`
```javascript
{text: /^age-(?<age>\d*)/, action: "age"}
```
Below, few examples of how to capture different payloads
```javascript
{payload: "carousel", action: "carousel"},
{payload: /^(yes|no)$/, action: "quickreply_response"}
```
It is posible to use a function test to capture any text that starts with `bye`
```javascript
{text: (t) => t.startsWith('bye'), action: "bye"}
```
You can move to a new action if a condition over the user input is met
```javascript
{input: (i) => i.type === "text" && i.intent === "greetings", action: "greet"}
```
Below, we see how to captures different intents (enable the Dialogflow integration)
```javascript
{intent: "smalltalk.agent.funny", action: "funny"},
{intent: "smalltalk.agent.good", action: "funny"},
{intent: "smalltalk.user.likes_agent", action: "funny"}
```
There's an implicit rule that captures any other input and maps it to
the `404` action, it would be equivalent to:
```javascript
{type: /^.*$/, action: "404"}
```
