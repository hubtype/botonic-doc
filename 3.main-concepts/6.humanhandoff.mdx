# **Human Handoff**

As bots arenâ€™t perfects, we allow to transfer a conversation into an agent.

In order to redirect the conversation to an agent in a specific action, you call the function `this.humanHandOff()` inside `botonicInit`.Then, the conversation is going to be transfered to the platform you have configured.
//TODO say something it's our dashboard?

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Botonic } from 'botonic'
export default class extends Botonic.React.Component {

  static async botonicInit({ req }) {
    this.humanHandOff()
  }

  render() {
    return (
        <message type="text">
            You are going to be transfered to an agent!
        </message>
    )
  }
}
```
