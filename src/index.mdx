# Introduction

Botonic is a React-based framework that allows you to build amazing conversational experiences, aka chatbots. The term "chatbot" was coined a long time ago and refers to an intelligent artificial agent you can talk to as if it was a human. So, according to this definition, this agent must have a way to understand human natural language, have a human-level context of the world, be able to reason and articulate responses also in natural language. It's obvious that the technology to achieve all that does not exist yet, however, we can still solve practical problems and automate processes through modern text-based interfaces (like messaging apps) that include features like:

* Guided flows
* NLU
* Multi-language
* Keeping context
* Dealing with media (images, video, location...)
* Webviews
* Human handoff

That's why we like to talk about *conversational experiences* rather than *chatbots*, as the latter implies an AI-centric, text-only interaction with your bot. If you want your bot to deliver a good user experience, you'll need to take into account all of these elements. Botonic allows you to orchestrate all these pieces in an elegant and simple way.
