# Webviews

## Introduction

Webviews are an essential part of Botonic and chatbots. This allows you to open standard webpages during a chat conversation, offering a rich experience and a set of features that are difficult to create with simple RCML messages.

One simple example could be the posibility of creating a webview for picking different products, selecting a range of dates from a datepicker or even buying some books.

With Botonic, it's easier to create webview than developing by your own a webpage and integrate it with the Facebook app, insert the Facebook SDK, keep the bot conversation flow, etc.

> #### Note
> The Webviews must be stored inside the `pages/webviews` folder.

## Steps

### Invoke a webview

You can only open a webview after a `button` or `quickreply`.

```javascript
<messages>
    <message type="text">
        Button with webview
        <button url="webviews/hello_world">Webview1</button>
    </message>
    <message type="text">
        Quickreply with webview
        <reply url="webviews/close">Webview2</reply>
    </message>
</messages>

```

Now, let's create this two Webviews.

### Create a webview

#### BotonicWebview

Facebook SDK is needed for opening a webview inside Messenger platform. We have encapsulated this information inside `BotonicWebview`.

In the `render()`function, we define the HTML page that is going to be displayed.

**pages/webviews/hello_world.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import BotonicWebview from 'botonic/lib/react/server/bundles/pages/webview'

export default class extends React.Component {

  	render() {
  		return(
  			<BotonicWebview/>
  			<div>
          		<p>Hello world</p>
      		</div>
		)
  	}
}
```

>#### Note
>To display a webview in your bot, you **must** whitelist the botonic domain `api.hubtype.com` in *whitelisted_domains* property of your [bot's Messenger Profile](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/reference/messenger-profile-api/domain-whitelisting)

#### CSS

In Botonic actions, importing css properties is as simple as is shown below.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import "../style.css"

export default () => <div className="example">Hello World!</div>

```

#### Close Webview

The close function allows you to send back data to the bot in order to continue with the conversation flow.

**pages/webviews/close.js**
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import BotonicWebview from 'botonic/lib/react/server/bundles/pages/webview'

export default class extends React.Component {

	static async getInitialProps(args) {
		return {...args.req}
	}

	render() {
	    return (
	      <div>
	          <BotonicWebview/>
	          <button onClick={() => BotonicWebview.close(this.props.context, 'PAYLOAD-DATA')}>
	          	Close
	          </button>
	      </div>
	    );
  	}
}
```

In this example, you can see that we have a button, and when it's triggered we send a postback to the bot with 'PAYLOAD-DATA' as a `payload`.
