# Webviews

## Introduction

Webviews are an essential part of Botonic and chatbots. This allows you to open standard webpages during a chat conversation, offering a rich experience and a set of features that are difficult to create with simple RCML messages.

One simple example could be the posibility of creating a webview for picking different products, selecting a range of dates from a datepicker or even buying some books.

With Botonic, it's easier to create webview than developing by your own the webpage and integrate it with the Facebook app, insert the Facebook SDK, keep the bot conversation flow, etc.

> #### Note
> The Webviews must be stored inside the `pages/webviews` folder.

## Steps

#### BotonicWebview

Facebook SDK is needed for opening a webview inside Messenger platform. We have encapsulated this information inside the BotonicWebview.

In th `render()`function, we create the HTML page that is going to be loaded in the webview.

**pages/webviews/hello_world.js**
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import BotonicWebview from 'botonic/lib/react/server/bundles/pages/webview'

export default class extends React.Component {

  	render() {
  		return(
  			<BotonicWebview/>
  			<div>
          		<p>Hello world</p>
      		</div>
		)
  	}
}
```
