# Actions

Actions consist of a simple units of logic that your bot can perform and the response that your bot will generate.

### Introduction

Botonic allows creating simple actions without any logic inside. The simplest response form of an action is a simple plain text.

**pages/actions/hello_world.js**

```javascript
export default () =>
    <message type="text">
        Hello World
    </message>
```

#### Botonic.React.Component

The essential purpose of the Botonic Component is to enable making API calls, having the full control of the bot and allowing the [HumandHandOff](#humandhandoff) or [Internationalization](#internationalization) in an easy way.

**pages/actions/john_doe.js**

```javascript
import { Botonic } from 'botonic'

export default class extends Botonic.React.Component {

	static async botonicInit({ req }) {
		req.user = {name: 'John Doe'}
  	}

	render() {
	    return (
	        <messages>
	            <message type="text">
	            	Hi {this.props.user.name}, I really like your history!
	            </message>
	        </messages>
	    )
	}
}
```
*Example of creating a new variable in `botonicInit` and using it in the `render`:*

![](https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/john_doe.png)

In `botonicInit({req})` is where all the logic takes place.

The `render()` is the function that describes what it will be returned as an output of the bot using [RCML](/api/rich-conversational-markup-language). All the variables defined in `botonicInit` are stored in `{this.props}`.

#### Request

We can access to different type of information inside the `req` param of the `botonicInit` function.

1. Input
	
	The type of data and the user input.
	`{'type': 'text', 'data': 'Hello, it's my first interaction'}`

2. Context

	The context is a group of variables that is always available at any action of the bot. It's recalculated every time there is an user input, so if a variable is updated in any state of the bot, this variable is going to be available and updated in all the others actions.
	//TODO talk about default data?

### HumandHandOff

As bots arenâ€™t perfects, we allow to transfer a conversation into an agent.

In order to redirect the conversation to an agent in a specific action, you call the function `this.humanHandOff()` inside `botonicInit`.Then, the conversation is going to be transfered to the platform you have configured.
//TODO say something it's our dashboard?

```javascript
import { Botonic } from 'botonic'
export default class extends Botonic.React.Component {

  static async botonicInit({ req }) {
    this.humanHandOff()
  }

  render() {
    return (
        <message type="text">
        	You are going to be transfered to an agent!
        </message>
    )
  }
}
```
