# Installing Botonic

Botonic bots are created and developed primarily through the Botonic command line utility (the "CLI") and deployed to the botonic.io cloud. This means we need to install the Botonic CLI to start developing.

## Getting Node and NPM

Most of the tooling in the CLI is based on Node and is managed through npm. The quickest way to get Node and NPM installed on your machine is through the [NodeJS installer](https://nodejs.org/). Be sure to install the LTS version of Node. Close any terminals/command prompts you may have open, run the installer, and launch a new terminal window. To verify you have everything installed correctly, you can run `npm --version` and `node --version`. If this errors, please resolve before moving on.

## Botonic CLI

With Node and NPM setup, let’s install the Botonic CLI. This will install few dependencies, namely `react`, `react-dom` and [`next`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) (which is an amazing library that lets you run React code in Node). It might take a while, so please be patient. If you encounter any problem please report it [here](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic/issues).

```bash
$ npm install -g botonic
```

> #### Note
> The -g means this is a global install, so for Windows you will need to open an Admin command prompt. For Mac/Linux, you might need to run the command with sudo.

Once that’s done, create your first Botonic bot:

```bash
$ botonic new testBot
```

> #### Note
> The CLI will prompt you to choose a template, you can optionally pass the name of the template as a second argument to avoid the prompt: `botonic new testBot tutorial`

To run your bot, `cd` into the directory that was created and then run the `botonic run` command to test your bot right in your terminal!

```bash
$ cd testBot
$ botonic run
```
