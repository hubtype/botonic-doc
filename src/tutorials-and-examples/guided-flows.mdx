# Guided Flow

[View on Github](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic/tree/master/templates/childs)

This template shows how to build a bot with deep flows, where users navigate a decision tree using interactive elements like buttons. This is useful when you want to guide the user through a conversation with predefined flows that consist of several steps. Examples of this type of bots include (but are not limited to):

* Surveys
* Pre-qulify leads before human handoff
* On-boarding processes
* FAQs (when you have a very limited set of options)

In the same way you build a website with a deep tree of routes, in botonic you make use of `childRoutes` to describe actions that are only accessible if the user is in the parent route.

With the following example we will see better how `childRoutes` work:

```javascript
routes: [
    {text: /^hi$/i, action: "hi",
        childRoutes: [
            {text: /^pizza$/i, action: "pizza", 
                childRoutes: [
                    {text: /^sausage$/i, action: "sausage"},
                    {text: /^bacon$/i, action: "bacon"}
                ]
            },
            {text: /^pasta$/i, action: "pasta", 
                childRoutes: [
                    {text: /^cheese$/i, action: "cheese"},
                    {text: /^tomato$/i, action: "tomato"}
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
] 
```

When the user starts the conversation the bot will ask whether he wants to eat pizza or pasta. You "force" the user to select either one by prompting two quick replies:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Botonic } from 'botonic'

export default class extends Botonic.React.Component {

  render() {
    return (
        <message type="text">
            Hi! Choose what you want to eat:
            <reply payload="pizza">Pizza</reply>
            <reply payload="pasta">Pasta</reply>
        </message>
    )
  }
}
```

We have the option of pizza and also pasta. This is where `childRoutes` comes in. Depending on our choice, chatbot will ask us different things. When choosing pizza, chatbot asks us if we want sausage or bacon as an ingredient, while with pasta chatbot will ask us if we want cheese or tomato. On the other hand, if you try to access the components of the ingredients directly you will not find them, since the path to access is `hi -> pizza / pasta -> ingredient`. This way, it is guaranteed that only if you have chosen the food first in this example, then can you choose the ingredient.
