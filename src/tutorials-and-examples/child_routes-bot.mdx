# Child Routes Bot

This template shows a simple case of use where a chatbot has different routes depends on what the user chooses.

The main objective of `child routes` is to access certain components depending on the previous route, in other words, that certain components are not always accessible.

With the following example we will see better how `child routes` work:

```javascript
routes: [
    {text: /^hi$/i, action: "hi",
        childRoutes: [
            {text: /^pizza$/i, action: "pizza", 
                childRoutes: [
                    {text: /^sausage$/i, action: "sausage"},
                    {text: /^bacon$/i, action: "bacon"}
                ]
            },
            {text: /^pasta$/i, action: "pasta", 
                childRoutes: [
                    {text: /^cheese$/i, action: "cheese"},
                    {text: /^tomato$/i, action: "tomato"}
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
] 
```

When you start the conversation with the chatbot you will ask us what we want to eat. We have the option of pizza and also pasta. This is where the `child routes` come in. Depending on our choice, chatbot will ask us different things. When choosing pizza, chatbot asks us if we want sausage or bacon as an ingredient, while with pasta chatbot will ask us if we want cheese or tomato. On the other hand, if you try to access the components of the ingredients directly you will not find them, since the path to access is `hi -> pizza / pasta -> ingredient`. This way, it is guaranteed that only if you have chosen the food first in this example, then can you choose the ingredient.
